# MCP SSH Agent Implementation Notes

## Final Implementation (v2.0 - Simplified SSH)

The MCP SSH Agent has been successfully implemented with a simplified, more reliable SSH approach that replaced the problematic `node-ssh` library.

### Architecture

1. **Main Server File**: `server-simple.mjs`
   - Pure JavaScript implementation using ES modules with createRequire
   - Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for MCP protocol compliance
   - Uses native `ssh` and `scp` commands via `child_process.exec()`

2. **Core Components**:
   - `SSHConfigParser`: Parses `~/.ssh/config` and `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
   - `SSHClient`: Handles all SSH operations using local SSH commands
   - MCP Server: Provides standardized tool interface

### Key Changes in v2.0

**Problem Solved**: The original implementation using `node-ssh` library failed with authentication errors ("All configured authentication methods failed") even though manual SSH connections worked perfectly.

**Solution**: Replaced `node-ssh` with direct execution of local `ssh` and `scp` commands using Node.js `child_process.exec()`. This approach:
- Leverages existing SSH infrastructure (agent, keys, config)
- Avoids JavaScript library authentication complexities  
- Is more reliable and simpler to maintain
- Provides better error messages and debugging

### MCP Protocol Implementation

- **Server Creation**: Uses `Server` class from MCP SDK
- **Transport**: `StdioServerTransport` for STDIO communication
- **Request Handlers**: 
  - `ListToolsRequestSchema`: Returns available SSH tools
  - `CallToolRequestSchema`: Executes SSH operations

### SSH Tools Provided

1. **listKnownHosts**: Returns all configured SSH hosts
2. **runRemoteCommand**: Executes single commands remotely using `ssh "host" "command"`
3. **getHostInfo**: Returns host configuration details
4. **checkConnectivity**: Tests SSH connectivity with simple echo test
5. **uploadFile**: Transfers files to remote hosts using `scp`
6. **downloadFile**: Downloads files from remote hosts using `scp`
7. **runCommandBatch**: Executes multiple commands sequentially

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **SSH Command Execution**: 
   ```javascript
   const sshCommand = `ssh "${hostAlias}" "${command.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}"`;
   const { stdout, stderr } = await execAsync(sshCommand, { timeout: 30000 });
   ```

2. **File Transfers**: 
   ```javascript
   // Upload: scp "localPath" "hostAlias:remotePath"
   // Download: scp "hostAlias:remotePath" "localPath"
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Proper timeout handling (30s for commands, 60s for transfers)

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Module Resolution**: Used `createRequire()` to handle MCP SDK CommonJS exports
2. **Schema Compliance**: Used proper MCP request schemas instead of string identifiers
3. **SSH Approach**: Native SSH commands instead of JavaScript SSH libraries
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
5. **File Structure**: Simplified to single main file to avoid build complexity

### Dependencies (Simplified)

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: MCP protocol implementation
- `ssh-config`: SSH configuration parsing
- Native Node.js modules: `child_process`, `util`, `os`, `fs`

**Removed**: `node-ssh`, `ssh2` (unreliable authentication)

### Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:

1. **Basic Functionality Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Test tools listing
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | node server-simple.mjs
   
   # Test SSH command execution
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"runRemoteCommand","arguments":{"hostAlias":"prod","command":"echo \"test\""}}}' | node server-simple.mjs
   ```

2. **SSH Connectivity**: Successfully tested against prod host (157.90.89.149:42077)
3. **Authentication**: Works with SSH agent and default key resolution
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error reporting for failed connections

### Performance and Reliability

- **Startup Time**: Fast server initialization (~1-2 seconds)
- **Command Execution**: Efficient direct SSH command execution
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - no persistent SSH connections
- **Reliability**: Leverages proven SSH infrastructure

### Usage

```bash
npm start  # Starts the MCP server on STDIO
```

The server is ready for integration with MCP-compatible clients and language models.

## Troubleshooting History

### Issue: SSH Authentication Failures with node-ssh

**Problem**: The original implementation using `node-ssh` consistently failed with:
```
Connection to prod failed: All configured authentication methods failed
```

**Investigation**:
- SSH config parsing worked correctly (prod host found)
- Manual SSH connection (`ssh prod echo test`) worked perfectly
- Multiple attempts to configure SSH agent, keys, and connection options failed
- Issue appeared to be with node-ssh library's authentication handling

**Solution**: Complete replacement with native SSH command execution
- Removed dependencies: `node-ssh`, `ssh2`
- Replaced with: `child_process.exec()` + local `ssh`/`scp` commands
- Result: Immediate success, much simpler code, better reliability

This demonstrates the value of using proven system tools over complex JavaScript libraries for system operations.

## Security Considerations

- Uses existing SSH key infrastructure
- No password storage or handling
- Relies on properly configured SSH authentication
- All operations respect SSH configuration restrictions

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep MCP SDK dependency updated for protocol compliance
- Monitor SSH library updates for security patches
- Test with various SSH configurations periodically
